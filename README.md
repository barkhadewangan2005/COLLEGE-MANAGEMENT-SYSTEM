        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### Email Configuration

For password reset and notifications, configure email in `settings.py`:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the Django test suite:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Check for any issues:

```bash
python manage.py check
```

## 🚀 Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`
2. Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with your domain
3. Use a production-grade database (PostgreSQL recommended)
4. Set up static file serving with Nginx/Apache
5. Use Gunicorn or uWSGI as WSGI server
6. Enable HTTPS with SSL certificate
7. Configure proper backup procedures
